# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning techniques in Python. 
Churn prediction is critical for SaaS and telecom companies to reduce revenue loss and improve customer retention.

Dataset: [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SHAP for explainability
- (Optional) Streamlit for deployment

## 🚀 Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training & Evaluation
4. Feature Importance with SHAP
5. Deployment (Streamlit)

## 📈 Results
- Best model: XGBoost with ROC-AUC of 0.87
- Key churn predictors: contract type, monthly charges, support calls

## 📸 Sample Visuals
- ROC curve
- SHAP summary plot
- Streamlit app screenshot

## 🎯 Future Work
- Try deep learning models (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Add time-series features
- Deploy model via Docker container
